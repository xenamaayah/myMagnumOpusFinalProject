This project is inspired by one of the assignments we had during the semester to play around with the granular synthesis patch. Ever since that assignment, I've thought about how I wanted to create the same effect I felt using the harp sound file in the granular patch but with added features. The sound coming from that patch felt very aury and haunted and i absolutely loved it! When we were introduced to the krell patch only a couple of weeks later, I knew I had to make them work in combination to create some cut-out sci-fi sounds that would work well together. That's when my idea came to mind! A HAUNTED ALIEN HOUSE PARTY!!! 

I have truly loved working on this assignment, even though it has taken me a long time and a lot of relearning and reunderstanding how some objects in Max operate and how to operate them well enough to create meaningul sound. 

Although I've had somewhat of a rough semester, given the immense workload of all my classes, this class was definitely one I looked forward to, even though I had little background in sound synthesis and felt like I wasnt good enough or creative enough at times. 

I hope you enjoy this little performance/instrument patch. I have decided in the end to keep the <live.drop> object as it allows for more creativity for future use (I'll definitely be playing around witht this over the break)! But for now, the harp sound file is in my media folder. 

Thank you for a beautiful semester! I truly learned a lot and felt engaged in what I've learnt!
